# Minimal Tech Portfolio (temporary)

This is a minimal, responsive, tech-themed portfolio scaffold with placeholder content.

Files added:

- `index.html` — main markup with `home`, `about`, `projects`, `contact`, and `more` sections.
- `styles.css` — minimalist dark theme with neon accent and responsive layout.
- `script.js` — small JS for mobile nav toggle, smooth scrolling, active nav highlighting, and a demo contact handler.

How to open locally (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
# From the project folder
ii index.html
```

Notes:
- The contact form is front-end only and simulates send behavior.
- Replace placeholder text and add links to real projects as needed.

If you'd like, I can:
- Add a deploy-ready `netlify.toml` / `github pages` setup
- Replace placeholder content with your real details
- Add icons and a small project gallery

Avatar / image holder:

- The hero contains a placeholder avatar (an inline SVG) inside the `.avatar` element in `index.html`.
- To use your image, replace the inline `<svg>` with an `<img>` tag. Example:

```html
<div class="avatar">
	<img src="me.jpg" alt="Your Name" />
</div>
```

Place your image file (for example `me.jpg`) in the project root or update the path accordingly.

Tell me which next step you want.
